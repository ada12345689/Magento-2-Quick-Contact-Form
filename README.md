Magento 2 Quick Contact Form lets your customers ask any question immediately while shopping and browsing your website with the help of the quick contact form.

With the rise of the online market, businesses are moving to the web. Online stores have more benefits compared to offline stores. But with an online store there arises a communication gap between the seller and the shopper. If the customer wants to ask anything about the product and service or any other information, one-to-one communication is not possible for online businesses and the customer feels lost as they are not aware of whom to ask for the answer. To overcome this matter, MageComp has come up with a [Quick Contact Form module](https://magecomp.com/magento-2-quick-contact-form.html) for all the Magento 2 store owners.
